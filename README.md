This was my second group project for my Spring 2025 DIG 4715C class. It is a stealth game with visual and gameplay direction heavily inspired by classic DOOM, from the blocky design to the lack of Y-axis camera movement. I worked as a programmer and level designer, whiteboxing and setdressing the layout given from team members, as well as programming functions such as movement, damage, and powerups.
